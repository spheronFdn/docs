This section will walk you through the process of deploying and managing a Spheron compute provider node. 

It covers everything from initial setup using Ansible to advanced configurations for GPU nodes. The guide includes step-by-step instructions for installing prerequisites, registering your provider, configuring the environment, setting up ingress, managing pricing, and installing necessary operators. 

It also provides detailed information on adding additional nodes to your cluster, including GPU nodes, and troubleshooting common issues. Whether you're setting up a basic CPU node or a more complex GPU-enabled provider, this guide offers the technical details needed to get your Spheron provider up and running efficiently.

We have created a [Provider Dashboard](https://provider.spheron.network) to check your provider details and see if your provider era uptime is up to the mark. Additionally, you can withdraw your earnings and view your provider's tier and the rewards you are accruing.
