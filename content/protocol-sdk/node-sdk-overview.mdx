# Node.js SDK Overview

The **[Spheron Protocol SDK for Node.js](https://github.com/spheronFdn/protocol-sdk/tree/main/nodejs)** provides a comprehensive set of modules to interact with the Spheron decentralized infrastructure. This includes modules for lease management, deployment operations, and escrow functionality.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Version 14 or higher.
- npm: Version 6 or higher.
- Docker: If you plan to run the Provider Proxy Server using Docker.
- Git: For cloning the repository if running the Provider Proxy Server from source.

## Installation

Install the Spheron SDK for Node.js using npm or yarn or bun:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'bun']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    npm install @spheron/protocol-sdk
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    yarn add @spheron/protocol-sdk
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>
    ```bash
    bun add @spheron/protocol-sdk
    ```
  </Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>
## Usage

### Initializing the SDK

To use the Spheron SDK, first import it and initialize it with the desired network type:

```javascript
const { SpheronSDK } = require('@spheron/protocol-sdk');

const sdk = new SpheronSDK('testnet');
```

**Note:** Chain type can be `testnet` or `mainnet`. But currently, only `testnet` is supported.

If you want to perform write operations, you'll need to provide a private key:

```javascript
const sdk = new SpheronSDK('testnet', 'your-private-key');
```

**Note:** Never hardcode your private key; use environment variables or secure key management systems.

**Constructor Parameters:**

- `networkType`: Specifies the environment. Possible values are `'testnet'` or `'mainnet'`.
- `privateKey` (optional): Private key for signing transactions.

### Modules Overview

The SDK provides several modules for different functionalities:

- **Escrow Module**: Handles escrow-related operations, such as user balance management, deposits, withdrawals, and earnings management.
- **Deployment Module**: Facilitates the creation, updating, and closing of deployments.
- **Lease Module**: Manages compute leases, including retrieving lease details and managing active leases.

## Modules

### Escrow Module

The Escrow Module handles operations related to the escrow system, allowing users to manage their token balances within the Spheron ecosystem.

```

**Parameters:**

- `token` (string): The token symbol. Supported tokens are `USDT`, `USDC`, `DAI`, and `WETH`.
- `walletAddress` (string, optional): The wallet address to query. If not provided, the wallet associated with the provided private key will be used.

**Returns:**

- `Promise<object>`: An object containing the user's balance information:

  - You can use the default proxy server provided by Spheron `https://provider-proxy.sphn.xyz` or set up your own proxy server. To set up your own proxy server, please refer to the [Provider Proxy Server](/protocol-sdk/provider-proxy-server) section.
  - To know more about the operator deployments, please refer to the [Operator Deployments](/user-guide/operator-deployments) section.

  // Handle successful result
} catch (error) {
  console.error('An error occurred:', error);
  // Handle error
}
```
