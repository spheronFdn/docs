# Deploy Your Container on Spheron using CLI

This guide will walk you through the steps to deploy and access your application on Spheron using CLI. Follow these steps carefully to ensure a successful deployment.

<Steps>
### Install Spheron Protocol `sphnctl` CLI (Linux, MacOS & Windows)

1. To install Spheron Protocol CLI using script, make sure you have [`curl`](https://curl.se/) installed on your system. To check, quickly:

```sh
curl --version
```

2. To install the Spheron Protocol CLI on the system, just run this one command in your terminal and pass the password during the prompt:

```sh
curl -sL1 https://sphnctl.sh | bash
```

2. Verify Spheron Installation

```sh
# Verify the installation by using a simple command to check the Spheron version
sphnctl version
```

### Create a new wallet using the CLI

To create a new wallet, start by configuring the name of your key. Run the command below, replacing `[wallet name]` with a name of your choice:

```sh
sphnctl wallet create --name [wallet name]
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Created account xxx:
 path: /Users/mitrasish-personal/.spheron/xxxxxyx.json
 address: 0x5C2432F3cB41927212e46e7224036d78eF3F2A93
 secret: xxxxxxxxxx
 mnemonic: xxxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxx xxxxx xxxxx
```

Make sure to read the output carefully and save your mnemonic phrase and key secret in a secure location. 

Once created, the wallet will be saved locally at `~/.spheron`. You can access the key-secret of the current wallet in `~/.spheron/config.json`. 
The newly created wallet will automatically be set as the current wallet. If needed, you can change the wallet by following the instructions in the [Changing Your Wallet](/rent-gpu/protocol-cli#changing-your-wallet) section.
You can also export the private key of your newly generated wallet. Please follow the instructions given in [Export the Private Key of Wallet](/rent-gpu/protocol-cli#export-the-private-key-of-wallet).

### Get uSPON tokens and ETH on Base Mainnet

2. Then, get some uSPON tokens on the Base mainnet from the Spheron team and ask them to send it to your wallet address.

3. Check if you got the uSPON tokens in your wallet:
```
sphnctl wallet balance --token uSPON
```
This will show both uSPON and ETH balances in your wallet.

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** 
- You need to send ETH to your wallet address to pay for the gas fees.
- You can get some credit token (uSPON) from the Spheron team if you are building something super amazing. Reach out to us on [Discord](https://sphn.wiki/discord) for that.
- Make sure to mention what you are building and how you are using Spheron Protocol, which compute or GPU you want to use and the duration you want to use it for. And finally, mention the wallet address you want to get the tokens in.
</Callout>

### Deposit some token to Your Escrow Balance

Depositing your tokens into the escrow is the first step to deploying your app on the Spheron Protocol. Ensure you have sufficient tokens in your escrow balance to lock the necessary funds for the deployment. Please follow the instructions below to proceed:

1. Deposit uSPON to the escrow wallet:

```
sphnctl payment deposit --amount 10 --token uSPON
```
Here, the amount must be in the full precision of the token. To determine the precision of the token you are depositing, please refer to the [Supported Payment Tokens](/rent-gpu/supports#supported-payment-tokens) section.

2. Now check if you have a balance in an unlocked state in your wallet:

```
sphnctl wallet balance --token uSPON
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** You can withdraw tokens from your unlocked balance at any time. However, if the tokens are in a locked state, you will not be able to withdraw them until you close your deployment. Upon closing, the locked tokens will be returned to the unlocked state after deducting provider charges and protocol fees.
</Callout>

### Set the C Base Mainnet RPC WSS URL

To ensure reliable Base Mainnet deployments, you should supply your own dedicated base mainnet RPC endpoint. Public base mainnet RPCs are rate-limited and can lead to failed or stalled deployments under load.

1. **Obtain a Custom RPC URL**

Choose any popular provider and create a free API key:
- Alchemy: https://www.alchemy.com/base
- Infura: https://docs.metamask.io/services/reference/base/
- QuickNode: https://www.quicknode.com/docs

2. **Set the Custom Base Mainnet RPC WSS URL**

Before deploying, you should set the Dedicated Base Mainnet RPC WSS URL by running the following command:

```sh
sphnctl set rpc [private RPC URL]
```

**Example:**

```sh
sphnctl set rpc wss://base-mainnet.g.alchemy.com/v2/your-api-key
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** The RPC URL should be in the format of `wss://[RPC URL]`. You need to get the websocket URL from the RPC provider.
</Callout>

### Deploy an app

Now let's deploy an app to Spheron Protocol. Please follow the instructions below to proceed:

**Important: Choosing Your Deployment Mode**

Spheron offers two deployment modes:

- **Provider Mode**: For stable, production-grade deployments with larger compute resources.
- **Fizz Mode**: For cost-effective, distributed deployments suitable for testing or less resource-intensive applications.

You can specify the mode in your ICL configuration under the `profiles` section. For example:

```yaml
profiles:
  name: hello-world
  duration: 1h
  mode: provider  # or 'fizz' for Fizz Mode
  tier:
    - community
  // ... other profile configurations ...
```

For this guide, we'll use Provider Mode. You may use the sample deployment file as-is or modify it for your own needs as described in our [ICL documentation](/rent-gpu/icl). A typical modification would be to reference your own image instead of our image.

```sh
cat > gpu.yml <<EOF
---
version: "1.0"

services:
  web:
    image: jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest
    expose:
      - port: 8888
        as: 8888
        to:
          - global: true
    env:
      - TEST=test
profiles:
  name: hello-world
  duration: 1h
  mode: provider # or 'fizz' for Fizz Mode
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 0.5
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi
  placement:
    westcoast:
      pricing:
        web:
          token: uSPON
          amount: 1
deployment:
  web:
    westcoast:
      profile: web
      count: 1
EOF
```

3. Deploy the configuration on Spheron Protocol, run:

```sh
sphnctl deployment create gpu.yml
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** If you're using the default public RPC with the CLI, your deployment might fail due to high latency and dropped events on the public endpoint. We strongly recommend setting up a private RPC (you can create one for free on platforms like QuickNode, Infura, or Alchemy).
</Callout>

If you proceed with the default public RPC, you'll see a warning message prompting you to switch to a private RPC for better reliability.
Something like this will be shown:

```sh
WARNING: You are using the default RPC URL, which may lead to deployment issues.
Please follow the documentation to obtain a custom base mainnet RPC URL: https://docs.spheron.com/rent-gpu/protocol-cli#setting-custom-base-mainnet-rpc-wss-url
Enter your custom base mainnet RPC URL here (click enter to continue with default one):
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Checking ballance for wallet: 0x2c11A76298A111B8cA8Db82205dc8f0A2688e6e8
Validating SDL configuration.
SDL validated.
Sending configuration for provider matching.
Deployment order created: [Tx Hash]

Deployment created using wallet 0x2c11A76298A111B8cA8Db82205dc8f0A2688e6e8
 lid: 44

 agreed price: 158747943694
Sending the manifest for deploymentâ€¦
Deployment manifest sent, waiting for acknowledgment.
Deployment is finished.
```

The `lid` that we get from the deployment is called **Lease ID** & 44 is the Lease ID in this example. This is the identifier that you need to use to access your deployment's logs and status.

### Access Your Deployment
To access your deployment / lease details, you need to run this command to fetch it:

This will contain URL to access the deployment server, all the assigned ports and the URI to access it. With this you can check your deployment status.

```sh
sphnctl deployment get --lid 44
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Status of the deployment ID: 44
Deployment details:
 Status:  Matched
 Provider:  avaaaa
 Price per hour:  1.21222
 Start time:  2024-07-25T10:10:12Z

Services running:
  web
    URL: []
    Ports:
      - provider.provider.devnetasphn.com:42100 -> 8888 (TCP)
    Replicas: 1/1 available, 1 ready
    Host URI: provider.devnetasphn.com
    Region: us-east
    IPs: []
```

### Fetching Deployment Logs

To fetch your deployment logs, you need to use the Lease ID.

```sh
sphnctl deployment logs --lid 44
```

Here is an example of how the result will look:

```sh
Here is the logs for the Lease ID: 44

### Connect to the deployment shell

To connect to the deployment shell, you need to run this command:

```sh
sphnctl deployment shell web /bin/sh --lid <LID> --stdin --tty 
```

Once you run this command, you will be connected to the shell of the deployment.

You can now run any command you want to interact with your deployment. For example, you can check the GPU count by running:

```sh
nvidia-smi
```
