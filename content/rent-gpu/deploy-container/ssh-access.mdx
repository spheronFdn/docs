# Generate SSH Keys

# Overview
SSH (Secure Shell) keys provide secure authentication for accessing your rented GPU instances on Spheron. This guide explains how to generate and set up SSH keys.

## What are SSH Keys?
SSH keys use public-key cryptography to authenticate connections:

- **Public Key**: Uploaded to Spheron and installed on the GPU server
- **Private Key**: Kept securely on your local machine
- **Key Pair**: The public and private keys work together to establish secure connections

## Prerequisites
- Local machine with terminal access 
- Spheron account with some credits

This guide will walk you through generating a new SSH key pair and configuring it for use with your Spheron GPU deployments.

<Steps>
### Open a Terminal
On your computer, open a terminal window.

### Run the SSH Key Generation Command
Type the following command and press Enter:

```sh
ssh-keygen
```

### Choose the Save Location
Press Enter to accept the default location (usually `~/.ssh/id_rsa`).

### Set a Passphrase (Optional)
You will be prompted to enter a passphrase to secure your key:
  1. To skip, just press Enter twice (once to skip, once to confirm an empty passphrase).
  2. To add extra security, enter a passphrase. (You will need to enter this passphrase whenever you use your SSH key.)

### Key Generation Complete
1. Once the key is generated, you will see output showing where your private and public keys have been saved.
2. Your public key file is usually named `id_rsa.pub` and is located in the `~/.ssh/` directory.

### Upload Your Public Key to Spheron Console
1. Go to **User Settings > SSH Settings** in your Spheron console.
2. Upload the contents of your `id_rsa.pub` file.

### Or Use CLI to setup SSH Key
Use the following command to setup your SSH key:

```sh
sphnctl deployment ssh set-key ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
```

This will allow you secure, remote access to your rented GPU.
