# Provider Mode vs Fizz Mode

This guide explains the key differences between Provider Mode and Fizz Mode in Spheron, helping developers choose the right deployment strategy for their applications.

## Overview

Spheron offers two distinct deployment modes, each designed for different use cases and requirements:

### Provider Mode
- Enterprise-grade infrastructure
- High reliability and stability
- Production-ready environment
- Higher resource availability
- Premium features and capabilities

### Fizz Mode
- Consumer-grade distributed network
- Cost-effective solution
- Community-driven infrastructure
- Suitable for testing and development
- Basic feature set

## Detailed Comparison

### 1. Networking Features

#### Provider Mode
```yaml
# Example Provider Mode networking configuration
expose:
  - port: 3000
    as: 80  # Can map to standard HTTP/HTTPS ports
    to:
      - global: true
    accept:
      - www.yourapp.com
```

- Supports ports 80 and 443
- Built-in HTTPS with self-signed certificates
- Subdomain-based access for port 80
- Load balancing capabilities with multiple containers by passing more than one count
- Higher bandwidth allocation

#### Fizz Mode
```yaml
# Example Fizz Mode networking configuration
expose:
  - port: 8080  # Cannot use ports 80/443
    to:
      - global: true
  - port_range: 8443-8445  # Supports port ranges
    port_range_as: 8443-8445
    to:
      - global: true
```

- Cannot use ports 80/443
- No built-in HTTPS
- Supports port ranges
- Basic networking features
- Variable bandwidth
- Can use `use_public_port` to expose your service so that container ports can be exposed to ports assigned by Spheron
- Can be used to deploy P2P applications and clustering applications

<Callout type="warning">
When using Fizz Mode, ensure your application doesn't rely on standard HTTP/HTTPS ports (80/443), as these are not available.
</Callout>

### 2. Resource Management

#### Provider Mode
```yaml
# Example Provider Mode resource configuration
profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 4
        memory:
          size: 8Gi
        storage:
          size: 20Gi
        gpu:  # GPU support available
          units: 1
          attributes:
            vendor:
              nvidia:
                - model: t4
```

- High resource limits
- GPU support
- Shared Memory (SHM) support
- Consistent performance
- Resource scaling options

#### Fizz Mode
```yaml
# Example Fizz Mode resource configuration
profiles:
  compute:
    web:
      resources:
        cpu:
          units: 0.5
        memory:
          size: 1Gi
        storage:
          size: 1Gi
```

- Limited resource availability - max 32 units of CPU, 128Gi of memory and 2000Gi of storage
- Variable performance - Can have downtime if fizz node is stopped by the user
- Updating resource in runtime is supported
- Shared Memory (SHM) is not supported
- You can change count to multiple containers in a single deployment

### 3. Logging and Monitoring

#### Provider Mode
```bash
# Real-time log following
sphnctl deployment logs --lid 123 --follow

# Service-specific logs
sphnctl deployment logs --lid 123 --service web
```

- Real-time log streaming - you can follow the logs as they are generated
- Advanced filtering options
- Service-specific logging
- Detailed event tracking - you can see all the events happening in your deployment

#### Fizz Mode
```bash
# Startup logs (Fizz-specific feature)
sphnctl deployment logs --lid 123 --startup

# Basic logs
sphnctl deployment logs --lid 123
```

- Real-time log streaming - you can follow the logs as they are generated
- Service-specific logging
- Detailed event tracking - you can see all the events happening in your deployment

### 4. Deployment Updates

#### Provider Mode
- Dynamic resource scaling - you can update the resource in runtime
- Live environment updates - you can update the environment variables in runtime
- Container image updates - you can update the container image in runtime
- Zero-downtime updates - you can update the container image in runtime without downtime
- Secure and more reliable - you can update the container image in runtime without downtime

#### Fizz Mode
- Dynamic resource scaling - you can update the resource in runtime
- Live environment updates - you can update the environment variables in runtime
- Container image updates - you can update the container image in runtime

## Best Practices

### When to Use Provider Mode

1. **Security Requirements**
   - HTTPS requirements
   - Custom domain needs
   - Compliance requirements

2. **Resource Intensive Applications**
   - ML/AI workloads
   - Data processing
   - GPU requirements

### When to Use Fizz Mode

1. **Cost-Sensitive Projects**
   - MVP deployments
   - Personal projects
   - Learning environments
   - Low-traffic applications

2. **Distributed Applications**
   - Edge computing or Edge GPU computing use cases
   - P2P applications
   - Decentralized services

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Provider Mode Issues

1. **Port Conflicts**
   - Verify port mappings
   - Use port 80 or 443 for your service if you want to use subdomain-based access

2. **Resource Allocation**
   - Check scaling configurations
   - Verify resource requests
   - Can deploy multiple GPUs for a single deployment

3. **Deployment Not Available**
   - Check the Replicas if it is 0 - wait for a few minutes for deployment to pull the image and start the containers, and check again
   - You can check the logs for more details using the flag `--follow` to see if there are any errors in the logs if the deployment is not available
   - You can also check the events using `sphnctl deployment events --lid <lid>` to see if there are any errors in the events like pull image failure, start container failure, etc.

### Fizz Mode Issues

1. **Connectivity**
   - Use correct port ranges
   - Check if the service is running on the correct port
   - Can use `use_public_port` to expose your service so that container ports can be exposed to ports assigned by Spheron - this is useful for P2P applications and clustering applications

2. **Performance**
   - Can deploy consumer-grade services with limited resources
   - GPU deployment is limited to 1 GPU per deployment

3. **Deployment Not Available**
   - If you see "Deployment details not available. No response from host."
   - Check startup logs to diagnose the issue:
     ```bash
     sphnctl deployment logs --lid <deployment-id> --startup
     ```
   - Startup logs will show the deployment initialization steps and help identify any problems
