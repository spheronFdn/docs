# Fizzer Onboarding Phases

We have launched 5 phases to onboard 100,000 Fizzers into the network. These Fizzers will form the foundation of Spheron, enabling AI from the edge and contributing to network decision-making and operations.

The phases are named after celestial bodies in our solar system, symbolizing our vision of a vast, interconnected network of compute nodes, each contributing to a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem.

## Frequently Asked General Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. How do I join the Fizz Node program? 
To join, simply register on the [Fizz platform](https://fizz.spheron.network/), download and install the Fizz Node on your device, and start contributing your computing power to the network.

#### 2. Which regions are eligible for participation?
Fizzer onboarding is open globally. Phase 1 successfully achieved participation from 170+ unique regions.

#### 3. What are FN points and how do I earn them? 
FN points are earned by running a Fizz Node and participating in the network. You can earn Liveness Rewards (FN points) for keeping your node online and active. [Click here](/fizz/reward-details) to learn more about rewards.

#### 4. Can I join Fizz Node if I don’t meet the minimum requirements? 
The program is designed for users who meet the minimum requirements. If your hardware does not meet these, you may need to upgrade before joining.

#### 5. What happens if I don’t meet the minimum system requirements? 
If you fall below the minimum system requirements, your points will be slashed.

#### 6. Can I still get the OG Fizzer or Lunar Fizzer role on Discord?
The OG Fizzer and Lunar Fizzer role was exclusive to the first 5,000 and 25,000 users who downloaded and ran the Fizz node on their devices. Unfortunately, it is no longer available.

#### 7. Will I still receive a Discord role if I join after the first 5,000 users?
Yes! Users who join after the first 5,000 will be assigned a Fizzer role based on the phase they joined (see phase details above).

#### 8. What is the difference between OG Fizzer, Lunar Fizzer and Stellar Fizzer roles? 
OG Fizzers are the first 5,000 participants, while Lunar Fizzers are part of Phase II (next 25,000 users). Same as Stellar Fizzers are the part of Phase III (Next 50,000 users)

#### 9. Can I transfer my Fizz Node to another wallet address if my wallet is compromised? 
Unfortunately, due to the on-chain nature of the network, you cannot transfer your current Fizz node to another wallet. If your wallet is compromised, you must register a new node with a different wallet address.

#### 10. Are there any fees to participate in the Fizz Node program? 
Yes, with the launch of Phase III, users will be required to pay a registration fee of 0.02 ETH. This phase offers a 1.5x boost to FN points, as well as priority support for any issues.

#### 11. Why didn’t earlier phases have a registration fee, and why is there a fee in Phase 3?

Here’s Why This Step was Necessary

- The registration fee helps protect against spam and DDoS attacks. 
- By limiting excessive or fake node registrations, the system remains efficient and stable for all. 
- By introducing a small cost, we ensure that only genuine contributors join the program, fostering a committed and authentic community.

Here's How We Maintained Fairness Through Tiers
- OG Fizzer : These were our earliest supporters who believed in Spheron from the start. They had the unique opportunity to earn more points during our early days as we worked on refining our systems and processes.
- Lunar Fizzer : This tier was created to welcome new supporters and test Spheron’s potential for system aggregation without any cost to them. It offered plenty of opportunities to earn points by contributing with the right resources and validations.
- Stellar Fizzer : This marks the phase when Spheron became fully mature and ready to take on the world. While this tier involves a cost, it allows supporters to contribute to a funding pool for key milestones, like launching Skynet, and provides them the means to achieve parity with earlier tiers.
- Nebula: The next most exclusive tier, designed for those who wish to witness Spheron’s true power at scale. It’s the most premium level and represents the peak of our journey.

#### 12. Can I run the Fizz Node on multiple devices? 
Yes, you can run the Fizz Node on different devices under one account, but each device must be registered separately with a unique wallet address.

#### 13. Is there a limit to how many nodes I can run? 
There is no strict limit you can run as many node you want with different system.

#### 14. What happens if I stop my Fizz Node? 
If you stop your Fizz Node, you will stop earning FN points and rewards. Ensure your node stays active to continue receiving rewards.

#### 15. How do I contact support if I have issues setting up my Fizz Node? 
For support, you can join our Discord community for assistance: [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/KJ5PhGv3Mw).
