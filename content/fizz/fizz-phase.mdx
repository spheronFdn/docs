# Fizzer Onboarding Phases

We have launched 5 phases to onboard 100,000 Fizzers into the network. These Fizzers will form the foundation of Spheron, enabling AI from the edge and contributing to network decision-making and operations.

The phases are named after celestial bodies in our solar system, symbolizing our vision of a vast, interconnected network of compute nodes, each contributing to a decentralized and self-sustaining ecosystem.

## Frequently Asked General Questions (FAQs)

#### 1. How do I join the Fizz Node program? 
To join, simply register on the [Fizz platform](https://fizz.spheron.network/), download and install the Fizz Node on your device, and start contributing your computing power to the network.

#### 2. Which regions are eligible for participation?
Fizzer onboarding is open globally. Phase 1 successfully achieved participation from 170+ unique regions.

#### 3. What are FN points and how do I earn them? 
FN points are earned by running a Fizz Node and participating in the network. You can earn Liveness Rewards (FN points) for keeping your node online and active. [Click here](/fizz/reward-details) to learn more about rewards.

#### 4. Can I join Fizz Node if I don’t meet the minimum requirements? 
The program is designed for users who meet the minimum requirements. If your hardware does not meet these, you may need to upgrade before joining.

#### 5. What happens if I don’t meet the minimum system requirements? 
If you fall below the minimum system requirements, you can't run the node.

#### 6. Can I still get the OG Fizzer or Lunar Fizzer role on Discord?
The OG Fizzer and Lunar Fizzer role was exclusive to the first 5,000 and 25,000 users who downloaded and ran the Fizz node on their devices. Unfortunately, it is no longer available.

#### 7. Will I still receive a Discord role if I join after the first 5,000 users?
Yes! Users who join after the first 5,000 will be assigned a Fizzer role based on the phase they joined (see phase details above).

#### 8. What is the difference between OG Fizzer, Lunar Fizzer and Stellar Fizzer roles? 
OG Fizzers are the first 5,000 participants, while Lunar Fizzers are part of Phase II (next 25,000 users). Same as Stellar Fizzers are the part of Phase III (Next 50,000 users)

#### 9. Can I transfer my Fizz Node to another wallet address if my wallet is compromised? 
Yes, you can transfer your Fizz Node to another wallet, but only if your current wallet is compromised. Please contact our team on Discord for help.

#### 10. Are there any fees to participate in the Fizz Node program? 
No, it's free to join the Fizz Node program. You can register your node and get a free Nebula NFT and the Nebula Fizzer role in our Discord community. If you want extra benefits, you can pay 0.02 ETH to get a 1.5x boost to FN points, a Stellar NFT, and the Stellar Fizzer role.

#### 11. Can I run the Fizz Node on multiple devices? 
Yes, you can run the Fizz Node on different devices under one account, but each device must be registered separately with a unique wallet address.

#### 12. Is there a limit to how many nodes I can run? 
There is no strict limit you can run as many node you want with different system.

#### 13. What happens if I stop my Fizz Node? 
If you stop your Fizz Node, you will stop earning FN points and rewards. Ensure your node stays active to continue receiving rewards.

#### 14. How do I contact support if I have issues setting up my Fizz Node? 
For support, you can join our Discord community for assistance: [Discord Link](https://discord.gg/KJ5PhGv3Mw).

#### 15. Do I need to keep my device online 24/7?
For best results and to maximize your rewards, yes. The more consistently your Fizz Node stays online, the more FN points you earn. Although, The minimum uptime required is 50%, which means your node should run for at least 12 hours a day to earn daily points.

#### 16. Can I use a Virtual Machine (VM) or VPS to run my Fizz Node?
We don’t recommend using a VPS to run your Fizz Node. The node is built to run best on bare metal systems, spare laptops, or regular personal computers. While it can technically run on a VPS, it can become expensive and isn't ideal for long-term use. Fizz Node is a core part of the Spheron ecosystem and is designed to stay active as long as the project exists.

#### 17. How do I check if my node is working correctly?
After setup, you can check your node status on the Fizz Dashboard. It shows your node’s active status and earned FN points.

#### 18. Can I change my system specs after I register a node?
Yes, you can upgrade or change your system. However, make sure the new system meets the minimum requirements.

#### 19. Are there penalties for downtime or inactivity?
Yes. If your node frequently goes offline or stays inactive, your FN points will be reduced (slashed), which affects your ranking and rewards.

#### 20. Can I switch phases or upgrade my Fizzer role?
No, you can’t switch phases. The phase is fixed based on the time you used to register your node. If you want to join a different open phase, you’ll need to register a new device to do so.
