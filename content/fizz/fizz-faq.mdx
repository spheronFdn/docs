# Fizz Node FAQ

#### 1. Is Docker installation mandatory before installing a Fizz Node?
No, it's not mandatory. The Fizz Node installation script handles Docker installation for you. However, if you already have Docker installed, please ensure it is updated to the latest version.

#### 2. How do I know if my Fizz Node is active?
To check if your Fizz Node is active, visit [Fizz Node Status](https://fizz.spheron.network/). If it shows as active, your node is running. If not, please reach out to our Discord community for assistance.

#### 3. How much can I earn, or is there a token allocated to Fizz Node Runners?
Spheron aims to maximize your earnings by creating a resource pool of idle resources. However, your earnings depend on various factors, including demand. In addition to direct utilization points, Spheron offers IDLE rewards in Fizz Node Points. The network requires a token to operate, and any related information will be communicated publicly.

#### 4. Can I run a Fizz Node on a Windows device?
Yes, you can run it on Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Please follow the steps provided [here](http://localhost:3000/fizz/setup-fizz#running-the-fizz-node-client-windows).

#### 5. When installing Docker, I'm receiving an "Incompatible CPU Detected" error on my M1/M2/M3 Mac. What should I do?

This error occurs because Homebrew installs the `amd64` (Intel) version of Docker, which isn't compatible with Apple Silicon (`arm64`) chips like M1, M2, and M3. To resolve this issue, you need to install the Docker version designed for Apple Silicon manually:

1. **Download the Correct Docker Version**:
   - Visit the [Docker Desktop for Mac (Apple Silicon)](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) page.
   - Click on **"Download for Mac with Apple Chip"** to get the compatible installer.

2. **Install Docker Manually**:
   - Open the downloaded `.dmg` file.
   - Drag and drop the Docker icon into the **Applications** folder.
   - Launch Docker from the **Applications** folder.

3. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Open a terminal window.
   - Run `docker --version` to ensure Docker is installed correctly and the error is resolved.

Installing Docker directly from the official website ensures compatibility with your Apple Silicon device and eliminates the "Incompatible CPU Detected" error. After you've installed Docker on your Mac and verified it's working, re-run the Fizz Node installation script. This time, it should work for you without any hiccups.

#### 6. Can I run multiple Fizz Nodes on a single device?

No, you can only run one Fizz Node per device. Each Fizz Node is designed to operate independently on a single machine. Additionally, each Fizz Node is mapped to a single wallet address, and you cannot use the same address for multiple Fizz Nodes. This limitation is in place for several reasons:

1. **Resource Management**: Running multiple nodes on a single device could lead to resource conflicts and performance issues.
2. **Fairness**: Limiting to one node per device helps maintain a fair distribution of nodes across the network.
3. **Security**: Mapping each node to a unique wallet address enhances the security and accountability of the network.

If you want to run additional Fizz Nodes, you'll need to use separate devices, each with its own unique wallet address.

#### 7. I have two or more GPUs in my device. Can I run the node to add them all?

This limitation is due to the Fizz Node Software's current design, which is optimized for single-GPU setups. However, the Spheron team is actively working on enhancing this capability.

Future updates aim to allow Fizz Nodes to utilize multiple GPUs simultaneously, which will enable users with multi-GPU setups to contribute more computational power to the network. This improvement will maximize the potential of high-performance systems and provide more flexibility for node operators.

Stay tuned for announcements from the Spheron team regarding updates that will enable multi-GPU support in Fizz Nodes.

#### 8. I'm getting a permission denied error when running the Spheron CLI. How do I fix this?

If you encounter a "permission denied" error. it's likely because the script is trying to access `/root/.spheron`, which your current user doesn't have permission to access. Switch to root and run the command again.

#### 9. Is my data secure using someone else's GPU through a Fizz Node?

When you use a Fizz Node, your data is processed on another user's GPU system. At present, there is no way to prevent a technically savvy GPU owner from accessing your data. We advise against using private or sensitive data on Fizz Nodes. If you need to work with sensitive information, consider using the **Provider** mode to deploy on data center-grade GPUs with enhanced security measures.

Alternatively, you can implement a system where a proxy server handles your data manipulation and storage. You can send data to the service running on the Fizz Node at runtime using secure connections or encryption for tasks like training or fine-tuning. After processing, the results can be retunred to your proxy server for further handling and secure storage. This approach makes accessing your data more difficult for the Fizz Node runner during runtime.

#### 10. How do I check the status of my Fizz Node?

To check the status of your Fizz Node, follow these steps:

1. **Access the Fizz Node Dashboard**:
   - Go to the Fizz Node dashboard by navigating to the 'My Fizz' Section.
   - If you're using the Spheron Fizz App, click the "Check Status" button.
   - Alternatively, you can use the command `sphnctl fizz logs` to check the status of your Fizz Node.

2. **Review the Status Information**:
   - The status information will be displayed in the output.
   - Look for the container status, which should indicate if the container is running (`Up`) or not (`Exited`).

3. **Check the Logs**:
   - If the container is not running, you can check the logs for any errors or issues by using the command `sphnctl fizz logs`.

4. **Verify the Node Status**:
   - If the container is running, your Fizz Node is active.
   - If the container is not running, you can start it again using the command `sphnctl fizz start --token ...'. replacing the `...` with your node-specific token.

By following these steps, you can verify the status of your Fizz Node and troubleshoot any issues if the container is not running.

#### 11. How do I check the reward details of my Fizz Node?

To check the reward details of your Fizz Node, follow these steps:

2. **Set up the PATH to Homebrew**:
   After installation, you need to ensure that Homebrew is in your system's PATH. Run this command to add Homebrew to your PATH:

   ```bash
   echo 'PATH="/usr/local/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile
   ```

   This command appends the Homebrew binary path to your bash profile.

3. **Reload your bash profile**:
   To apply the changes immediately, run:

   ```bash
   source ~/.bash_profile
   ```

4. **Verify Homebrew installation**:
   Test if Homebrew is working correctly by running:

   ```bash
   brew help
   ```

   If Homebrew is properly installed and configured, you should see the help output for Homebrew commands.

5. **Run the Fizz Node script again**:
   If the brew command is now working properly, you can run the Fizz Node command again:

   ```bash

#### 96. How often does the system check my node's liveness?  
The network pings your node once per hour to verify liveness. If your node is unresponsive during a ping, it fails that hour's liveness check.  

#### 97. I'm trying to add another Fizz Node. Is there a limit per wallet?  
You can run multiple nodes on different machines under one account, but only one wallet can be used per device.  

#### 98. I mistakenly chose GPU settings, but my system has no GPU. Can I switch?  
Yes. Go to the **Resources** section in your Fizz dashboard and change your GPU allocation to **None**.  

#### 99. Is running the node on a VPS CPU still incentivized?  
Yes. You can earn FN Points even on a CPU-only node.  

#### 100. I see this message: "Event file .spheron/fizz-docker-events/0.json does not exist." What does it mean?
This is not an error; the script will continue to run normally.  

#### 101. Can I transfer my node to another VPS using the same wallet?  
Yes. Stop your node on the old VPS, then run the setup script on the new VPS.  

#### 102. Why is my bandwidth usage at 0 when my node is active?  
Dashboard metrics can lag. If bandwidth remains at 0 for an extended period and your node is otherwise active, reach out to the support team via Discord.  

#### 103. Can I run a node on a VPS without a GPU?  
Yes. Just select **CPU-only mode** when setting up the node.  

#### 104. Can I set up a Fizz Node outside a container?  
No. Fizz Nodes must run within the containerized environment provided by the Spheron CLI.  

#### 105. Does Fizz Node require root access to run correctly?  
Yes, root privileges are needed to ensure the node can manage the necessary resources and configurations.  

#### 106. Why does `nvcc` show the wrong CUDA version after installing CUDA 12.6?
This happens when multiple CUDA versions are present on your system. Here's how to fix it:

1. **Check for existing CUDA installations**:
   ```bash
   ls /usr/local | grep cuda
   ```

2. **Remove old CUDA version**:
   - If you see `cuda` or a specific version like `cuda-11.5`:
   ```bash
   rm /usr/local/cuda    # or
   rm /usr/local/cuda-11.5
   ```

3. **Remove existing nvcc**:
   ```bash
   sudo rm $(which nvcc)
   ```

4. **Set up the new CUDA path**:
   Add these lines to your `.bashrc`:
   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/bin:$PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda-12.6/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> ~/.bashrc
   source ~/.bashrc
   ```

This will ensure your system uses the correct CUDA version.

#### 107. How do I upgrade my Fizz Node?
1. Upgrade your CLI to the latest version.
```bash
curl -sL https://sphnctl.sh | bash  
```
This will update your CLI to the latest version.

2. Now generate a new token by clicking on the "Generate Command" button on the Fizz dashboard.

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** If you see your generate button is disabled, you need to either confirm the resource update section or cancel it if you don't want to update the resources.
</Callout>

3. Run the following command to run the latest version of the Fizz Node.
```bash
sphnctl fizz start --token ...
```
This will start the latest version of the Fizz Node.

4. Verify that the CLI and node versions are up-to-date by running the following command:
```bash
sphnctl fizz version
```
This will display the current version of the CLI and node.

5. To check the logs of the Fizz Node, run the following command:
```bash
sphnctl fizz logs
```
This will display the logs of the Fizz Node.

6. Now check your dashboard to see the updated version of the Fizz Node.

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** It might take a few minutes to update the node version on the dashboard.
</Callout>

#### 108. Why is my Fizz Node showing Paused Status? How will it go to normal status?
Your node will go to Paused status if it performance is showing **No** for more than 5 days consecutively. To go to normal status, your node needs to show **Yes** for couple of days consecutively, it will automatically go to normal status. No need to do anything from your side.

#### 109. How can I resolve Docker Hub rate limit errors when running my Fizz Node?
If you're experiencing Docker Hub rate limit errors while running your Fizz Node, you can authenticate using your Docker Hub credentials to bypass these limitations. This is particularly useful if you have a Docker Hub Pro account. To authenticate, use the following command format:

```bash
sphnctl fizz start --token <your-token> -u <dockerhub-username> -p <dockerhub-password-or-token>
```

Replace:
- `<your-token>` with your Fizz Node token
- `<dockerhub-username>` with your Docker Hub username
- `<dockerhub-password-or-token>` with your Docker Hub password or access token

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** For security reasons, it's recommended to use a Docker Hub access token instead of your password. You can generate an access token from your Docker Hub account settings.
</Callout>
