# Setup Fizz Node

Setting up a Fizz node allows you to participate in the Spheron network and earn points by providing computational resources. This guide will walk you through the process of registering and setting up your Fizz node.

## Registration Process

To begin, you must register your Fizz node on the Spheron network. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [fizz.spheron.network](https://fizz.spheron.network) in your web browser.
2. Look for and click on the "Register a Fizz Node" button to start the registration process.
3. You'll be presented with a registration form. Fill it out carefully with the following information:

   - **Operating System**: Select your node's OS from the options provided (MacOS, Linux, or Windows).
   - **Node Type**: Specify whether you're setting up a GPU node or a CPU node. This determines the type of computational resources you'll be providing.
   - **GPU Model** (if applicable): If you selected GPU node, choose the specific GPU model you're using.
   - **Resource Details**: Provide accurate information about the resources you're willing to lend, including:
     - CPU cores
     - RAM capacity
     - Available storage

      </Callout>
   - **Region**: Select the geographical location where your node is situated. This helps users choose nodes based on their proximity requirements.
   - **Gateway Selection**: This is a crucial step. Choose a gateway carefully, considering factors such as:
     - The number of fizz nodes connected to the gateway. A gateway can't connect more than 2000 fizz node so select another gateway which is nearest to you.
     - Proximity to the gateway, make sure you choose the gateway which is nearest to you so that the latency is not too high for users who want to use your GPU / compute.
     - Try to select the recommended gateway in the list as the dashboard already selects the gateway based on your node preferences.

4. To complete the registration, you'll need some ETH on the Spheron chain for gas fees. If you don't have any, you can get some from our faucet at [faucet.spheron.network](https://faucet.spheron.network).

5. Now click on the "Register Your Fizz Node" button. 

6. For the Stellar phase and beyond, node registration requires:
   - A deposit of 0.02 ETH
   - This can be deposited on any of our supported mainnet chains:
     - Base
     - Arbitrum
     - ZkSync Era
     - BNB Chain
     - Ethereum

7. Click on **"Proceed with Payment"** button. [Why taking a fee?](/fizz/fizz-phase#why-didnt-earlier-phases-have-a-registration-fee-and-why-is-there-a-fee-in-phase-3)

8. Once you confirm all the transactions including the deposit, your node will be officially registered in the Spheron network, and you can proceed to the next steps.

<Callout type="warning">
Note: Please make sure to confirm all the transactions including the deposit, otherwise your node will not be registered and you might need to re-register your node.

## Learn About Your System Specs / Resources

### Mac Users: How to Check Your System Configuration

Before we start, you need to open something called the Terminal. It's like a special notepad where you can type commands to talk to your computer. Here's how to find it:

1. Look for a magnifying glass icon at the top right of your screen. That's called Spotlight.
2. Click on it or simultaneously press the Command (⌘) key and Space bar.
3. Type "Terminal" and press Enter.
4. A white or black window will open. That's the Terminal!
