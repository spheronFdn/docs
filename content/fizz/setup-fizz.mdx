# Setup Fizz Node

Setting up a Fizz node allows you to participate in the Spheron network and earn points by providing computational resources. This guide will walk you through the process of registering and setting up your Fizz node.

## Registration Process

To begin, you must register your Fizz node on the Spheron network. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to [fizz.spheron.network](https://fizz.spheron.network) in your web browser.
2. Look for and click on the "Register a Fizz Node" button to start the registration process.
3. You'll be presented with a registration form. Fill it out carefully with the following information:

   - **Operating System**: Select your node's OS from the options provided (MacOS, Linux, or Windows).
   - **Node Type**: Specify whether you're setting up a GPU node or a CPU node. This determines the type of computational resources you'll be providing.
   - **GPU Model** (if applicable): If you selected GPU node, choose the specific GPU model you're using.
   - **Resource Details**: Provide accurate information about the resources you're willing to lend, including:
     - CPU cores
     - RAM capacity
     - Available storage

      </Callout>
   - **Region**: Select the geographical location where your node is situated. This helps users choose nodes based on their proximity requirements.
   - **Gateway Selection**: This is a crucial step. Choose a gateway carefully, considering factors such as:
     - The number of fizz nodes connected to the gateway. A gateway can't connect more than 2000 fizz node so select another gateway which is nearest to you.
     - Proximity to the gateway, make sure you choose the gateway which is nearest to you so that the latency is not too high for users who want to use your GPU / compute.
     - Try to select the recommended gateway in the list as the dashboard already selects the gateway based on your node preferences.

5. Now click on the "Register Your Fizz Node" button. 

6. For the Stellar phase and beyond, you have two registration options:

   **Option 1: Stellar NFT Registration (Recommended)**
   - A deposit of 0.02 ETH to receive a Stellar NFT
   - Get a 1.5x booster on all your points earned
   - This can be deposited on any of our supported mainnet chains:
     - Base
     - Arbitrum
     - ZkSync Era
     - BNB Chain
     - Ethereum
   - The 1.5x booster significantly increases your earning potential and helps you progress through tiers faster

   **Option 2: Nebula NFT (Free Registration)**
   - Register your node without any deposit
   - Run your node normally without any point multiplier
   - Standard point earning without any boosters

   We strongly recommend Option 1 (Stellar NFT) as the 1.5x booster provides substantial benefits to your earning potential and helps you progress through tiers much faster.

7. If you select the Stellar NFT, Click on **"Proceed with Payment"** button. [Why taking a fee?](/fizz/fizz-phase#why-didnt-earlier-phases-have-a-registration-fee-and-why-is-there-a-fee-in-phase-3)

   If you select the Nebula NFT (Free Registration), you can proceed directly to the next step without any payment.

8. Once you confirm the payment transaction (for Stellar NFT), your node will be officially registered in the Spheron network, and you can proceed to the next steps. No additional transactions are needed for either option.

<Callout type="warning">
Note: Please note that we have removed the transaction requirement going forward for both options. So that you don't need to pay any gas fees for the registration. All the gas fees will be covered by the Spheron team.

## Learn About Your System Specs / Resources

### Mac Users: How to Check Your System Configuration

Before we start, you need to open something called the Terminal. It's like a special notepad where you can type commands to talk to your computer. Here's how to find it:

1. Look for a magnifying glass icon at the top right of your screen. That's called Spotlight.
2. Click on it or simultaneously press the Command (âŒ˜) key and Space bar.
3. Type "Terminal" and press Enter.
4. A white or black window will open. That's the Terminal!

Now that you have the Terminal open, you can type these magic words (we call them commands) to learn about your computer:

- **Check Storage Type:**
   ```sh
   system_profiler SPStorageDataType
   ```

- **Check Hardware Specifications:**
   ```sh
   system_profiler SPHardwareDataType
   ```

- **Check GPU Type:**
   ```sh
   system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType
   ```


### Linux Users: How to Check Your System Configuration

To use these commands:
1. Click inside the Terminal window.
2. Type or copy-paste one of the commands above.
3. Press the Enter key.
4. The computer will show you some information. That's what we're looking for!

- **Check Storage Information:**
   ```sh
   df -h
   ```

- **Get Detailed Hardware Information:**
   ```sh
   sudo lshw
   ```

- **List CPU Information:**
   ```sh
   sudo lshw -class processor
   ```

- **List Memory Details:**
   ```sh
   sudo lshw -class memory
   ```

## Running the Fizz Node Client (Linux/Mac)

After successfully registering your node, you need to set up and run the Fizz node client on your machine. This client software connects your node to the Spheron network and manages resource allocation. Follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the following command in your terminal to install the Fizz CLI:
```sh
curl -sL https://sphnctl.sh | bash  
```
2. Go to the Setup page on the Fizz Website. Click "Generate Command" to obtain your node-specific commands.
![Fizz Generate Command](/fizz-generate-command.webp)

3. Use the below command to start your node, replacing the `...` with your node-specific token:
```sh
sphnctl fizz start --token ...  
```
4. Monitor your node's logs to ensure it is running smoothly:
```sh
sphnctl fizz logs  
```
5. Verify that the CLI and node versions are up-to-date by running the following command:

```sh
sphnctl fizz version  
```

<Callout type="info">
If your dashboard doesn't reflect the updated version immediately, refresh the page. The version information should update within 2-3 minutes.
</Callout>

6. Once you've verified the node is running, return to the setup page on the Spheron Fizz App.
7. On the setup page, you'll see a "Check Status" button and a switch to "Autocheck status." 
8. Click the "Check Status" button to manually initiate a status check for your Fizz node. Or you can run the below command on CLI.
```sh
sphnctl fizz status  
```
9. Alternatively, you can toggle on the "Autocheck status" switch to have the system periodically check your node's status without manual intervention.
10. The system will now perform checks to validate if your node is active and correctly configured.

<Callout type="info">
  The validation process may take a few minutes. During this time, the system verifies your node's connectivity, resource availability, and configuration.
</Callout>

11. Once your node is confirmed active, you will be automatically directed to your Fizz dashboard.

## Running the Fizz Node Client (Windows)

1. Before proceeding, ensure your NVIDIA drivers and CUDA version are up-to-date. Open your terminal and run:

```sh
nvidia-smi
```
