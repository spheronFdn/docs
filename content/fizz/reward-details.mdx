# Reward Details for Fizz Nodes

To understand the rewarding system for Fizz nodes, let's first understand how reward emission works in the Spheron Protocol.

## Reward Emission

Fizz nodes are incentivized with liveness points based on the resources they contribute to the network. This approach encourages participation and helps cover operational expenses (OpEx).

- The liveness points are currently issued in FN (Fizz Node) Points until team announces something else. These points are non-transferable.
- The liveness point is issued every **ERA** (which is 24 hours) and will be accumulated in the Fizz node's wallet. 

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** Fizz node operators are advised to securely save their wallet address to avoid losing the points. Alternatively, you can use a burner wallet to hold the points which will be used to claim the rewards. Please make sure to not get your wallet compromised.
</Callout>

Liveness points are determined based on the following factors:

### Resource Rewards

Fizz earns points based on the GPU and compute resources it provides to the network. The higher the quality of the resource, the better the reward multiplier. Different resource categories will be introduced, each with different base points and multipliers based on tiering (e.g., CPU tiering). Currently, only GPU tiering with 10 tiers has been introduced.

**How are resource points calculated?**

Let's say you have **x** units of **GPU A**, which falls in **Medium Tier 1** with a multiplier of **1x**, and **y** units of **GPU B**, which falls in **High Tier 2** with a multiplier of **6x**. The base reward for GPU Tier is **k**. The resource reward calculation will be: 
```
(x * 1 + y * 6) * k
```

### GPU Resource Tiering

Fizz Node can earn points based on the GPU resources they contribute to the network. Different GPU models are categorized into tiers, each with its own multiplier. The higher the tier and multiplier, the greater the points for that GPU. Below is a table showing all supported GPU models, their tiers, and corresponding multipliers:

| GPU Model                | GPU Name        | Tier     | Multi plier | FN  | GPU / hr   | GPU / mo   | CPU / mo | RAM / GB/mo | Stor / GB/mo     |

### Liveness Requirement and Reward Calculation

Unlike provider nodes, Fizz nodes do not have a trust tiering system. The network assumes Fizz nodes are less reliable and suitable for specific use cases that don't require highly stable systems. However, there are specific liveness and resource requirements that determine reward accrual:

#### ⚖️ How Reward Accrual Works

We determine reward accrual based on two main factors: uptime and resource delivery.

#### 🕒 Uptime Rules:

- **Below 50% uptime**: If a node has less than 50% uptime during an ERA, it will not accrue any rewards for that period. We treat it as completely unreliable.
- **Above 50% uptime**: If uptime is above 50%, we then evaluate how well the node delivered on its promised resources to determine the final reward amount.

#### 📉 Resource-Based Reward Reduction:

When a node meets the minimum 50% uptime requirement, we evaluate its resource delivery performance. If the node didn't meet its promised resource allocations, we reduce its rewards proportionally based on how much it underdelivered.

**Resource Evaluation Categories:**
- **CPU**
- **Memory (RAM)**
- **Storage**
- **GPU** (if applicable)

**Resource Weights:**

The importance of each resource depends on whether the node claimed to have a GPU:

**If GPU is present:**
- CPU = 20%
- Memory = 10% 
- Storage = 10%
- GPU = 60%

**If no GPU:**
- CPU = 50%
- Memory = 25%
- Storage = 25%

**Reward Reduction Calculation:**

For each resource category, if the node underdelivered on its promises, we reduce the rewards by a percentage equal to:

```
Reward Reduction = (Resource Shortfall Percentage) × (Resource Weight)
```

**Example:** If a node with GPU promised certain resources but only delivered:
- 50% of promised CPU → 50% shortfall × 20% weight = 10% reward reduction
- 80% of promised Memory → 20% shortfall × 10% weight = 2% reward reduction  
- 90% of promised Storage → 10% shortfall × 10% weight = 1% reward reduction
- 70% of promised GPU → 30% shortfall × 60% weight = 18% reward reduction

**Total reward reduction = 10% + 2% + 1% + 18% = 31%**

So the node would receive 69% of its potential rewards for that ERA.

### How Liveness is Calculated

Liveness for Fizz nodes is calculated using an hourly challenge system:

- Every hour, at multiple random times, the network checks if the Fizz node is live and operational.
- The network will also check if your node is maintaining the latest version of fizz node both Fizz Node version and the CLI version. The latest version will change as team releases new versions. Please make sure to be active on the Spheron Discord server to get notified for the latest versions.
- During this hourly check, the network also validates that the available resources (GPU VRAM, CPU, RAM, and Storage) match what was claimed during node registration, excluding resources currently being utilized.
- If the node responds successfully to the challenge and passes the resource validation, it passes the liveness check for that hour.
- If the node fails to respond or fails the resource validation, the liveness check for that hour fails.
- The network tracks both uptime percentage and resource delivery performance throughout the ERA.

#### 🧠 Summary:

- **Poor uptime (< 50%)** = no rewards accrued for that ERA
- **Good uptime (≥ 50%)** = rewards calculated with potential reductions based on resource delivery performance
- **Resource weights** depend on whether GPU was promised
- **Multiple resource shortfalls** can compound to significantly reduce rewards

<Callout type="warning">
**Important:** Ensure you verify your available resources in the dashboard after connecting your Fizz node. If the actual resources differ from what was claimed, update your setup and restart the node. Failing resource validation will result in failed liveness checks and reduced rewards based on the resource shortfall calculations above.
</Callout>

This system ensures that Fizz nodes are incentivized to maintain both reasonable availability and accurate resource reporting without the stricter requirements placed on provider nodes.

## Reward Calculation

The reward for Fizz nodes is calculated based on multiple factors that ensure both resource contribution and reliable performance:

1. **Base Resource Contribution**: The amount and quality of resources (e.g., GPU, CPU, storage) contributed to the network.
2. **Uptime Performance**: Whether the node maintained at least 50% uptime during the ERA.
3. **Resource Delivery Performance**: How well the node delivered on its promised resource allocations.

The final reward for an ERA is calculated as follows:

```
ERA Reward = Base Resource Points * Uptime Factor * Resource Delivery Factor

Where:
- Base Resource Points = calculated based on contributed resources
- Uptime Factor = 1 if uptime ≥ 50%, or 0 if uptime < 50%
- Resource Delivery Factor = 1 - (Total Resource Shortfall Reduction Percentage)
```

**Detailed Calculation Steps:**

1. **Calculate Base Resource Points** using the tier multipliers from the resource tables above
2. **Apply Uptime Factor**: If uptime < 50%, final reward = 0 (no further calculation needed)
3. **Calculate Resource Delivery Factor** (if uptime ≥ 50%):
   - For each resource category (CPU, Memory, Storage, GPU), calculate: `(Shortfall %) × (Resource Weight)`
   - Sum all resource shortfall reductions
   - Resource Delivery Factor = `1 - (Total Shortfall Reduction)`
4. **Final ERA Reward** = `Base Resource Points × 1 × Resource Delivery Factor`

**Example Calculation:**
- Base Resource Points: 500 (for RTX 4090)
- Uptime: 80% (≥ 50%, so Uptime Factor = 1)
- Resource shortfalls: 10% CPU, 5% Memory, 0% Storage, 20% GPU
- Resource shortfall reductions: (10% × 20%) + (5% × 10%) + (0% × 10%) + (20% × 60%) = 2% + 0.5% + 0% + 12% = 14.5%
- Resource Delivery Factor: 1 - 0.145 = 0.855
- **Final ERA Reward: 500 × 1 × 0.855 = 427.5 points**

## Direct Earnings from Users

In addition to the liveness points, Fizz node operators can earn directly from users who lease their compute resources, providing an additional revenue stream for node operators.

### How Direct Earnings Work

1. **User Leasing**: When a user leases compute resources from your Fizz node using your client, they pay fees based on the pricing you set during the setup.

2. **Immediate Earnings**: These earnings are credited to your account immediately after the lease is completed.

3. **Withdrawal**: You can withdraw your earnings at any time from your dashboard.

### Fee Structure

While you receive the majority of the earnings from user leases, there are some fees associated with each transaction:

- **Foundation Fee**: 5% of the earnings goes to the Spheron Foundation
- **Gateway Fee**: 2% of the earnings go to the Gateway

This means that as a Fizz node operator, you receive 90% of the total amount paid by the user for leasing your compute resources.

## Security Compliance and Network Integrity

To maintain the security and integrity of the Spheron network, all Fizz nodes are equipped with comprehensive security monitoring systems. These systems are designed to protect user workloads and ensure the trustworthiness of the network.

### What We Monitor

The Fizz node security module continuously monitors for potential violations, including but not limited to:

- **Unauthorized access attempts** to user workloads
- **Improper termination** of user workloads
- **Data integrity violations** or unauthorized data access
- **Network security breaches** or suspicious activities

### Compliance Requirements

- Maintain the integrity of user workloads deployed on their nodes
- Refrain from accessing, modifying, or interfering with user data or applications
- Ensure their systems are secure and free from malicious software
- Follow all network protocols and security guidelines

### Enforcement Process

**Progressive Enforcement:**
- **Warning Phase**: Initial security violations trigger warning notifications visible on your dashboard
- **Monitoring Phase**: Continued violations result in enhanced monitoring and additional scrutiny
- **Network Suspension**: Persistent violations may result in temporary or permanent removal from the network

### Consequences of Violations

**For Severe or Repeated Violations:**
- **Network Ban**: Complete removal from the Fizz network
- **Point Forfeiture**: Loss of all accumulated FN (Fizz Node) Points
- **Access Restriction**: Inability to operate future Fizz nodes

<Callout type="error">
**Important Notice**: Network bans result in the complete forfeiture of all accumulated points and permanent restriction from network participation. This measure ensures the security and trustworthiness of the Spheron ecosystem.
