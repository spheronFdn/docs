<VideoPlayer embedId="a1EoK91Cjzk" />

This section will guide you through the process of deploying and managing a Spheron Fizz node. 

Fizz nodes are designed for users who want to contribute compute resources to the Spheron network without the higher reliability requirements of full provider nodes. This guide covers everything from initial setup to advanced configurations, including:

- Step-by-step instructions for installing prerequisites
- Registering your Fizz node
- Managing pricing for your compute resources
- Installing necessary software and drivers

Whether you're setting up a basic CPU node or a more powerful GPU-enabled Fizz node, this guide provides the technical details needed to get your node up and running efficiently on the Spheron network.

We have created a [Fizz Node Dashboard](https://fizz.spheron.network) where you can:
- Check your Fizz node details
- Monitor your node's uptime and performance
- View and withdraw your earnings from both liveness rewards and direct user leases
- Manage your node's settings and resource offerings

Join the Spheron network as a Fizz node operator and start earning rewards for your contributed compute resources today!
