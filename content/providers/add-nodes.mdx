# Adding Nodes to a Spheron Provider

This document provides step-by-step instructions for adding both CPU and GPU nodes to a Spheron cluster. It includes preparations, script modifications, and necessary commands to ensure successful integration and functionality of the nodes within the cluster.

1. [Adding a CPU Node](/providers/add-nodes#adding-a-cpu-node)
2. [Adding a GPU Node](/providers/add-nodes#adding-a-gpu-node)

## Adding a CPU Node

To add a CPU node to your Spheron cluster, follow these steps:

### Preparing a Node for Installation

#### 1. Prepare a node for the installation using Ansible from the [earlier step](/providers/setup-provider).
#### 2. Clone the Provider Deployment Repository

If you haven't already, clone the Spheron provider deployment repository: [spheronFdn/provider-deployment](https://github.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment)

```
git clone https://github.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment.git
```

Repo has the following file structure: 
![Provider Deployment Repo](/provider-deployment-repo.webp)

#### 3. Edit the Inventory File

Open `playbook/inventory.ini` and update it with your server details. Example:

<Callout type="info">
Ensure you set up the server IP, username, and SSH key correctly.
</Callout>

```
[testnet] 
server-name ansible_host=23.158.40.38 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
#### 4. Execute the Ansible Playbook

```
cd playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```
- The server will restart after the execution. When prompted, say `No` to the request for the first node.

![Provider Deployment Repo](/cpu-node-1.webp)

- Follow the Prompt like this:

![Provider Deployment Repo](/cpu-node-2.webp)

#### 5. SSH into the Master Node
SSH into the first node (master node) of the cluster and follow the steps:

- Add the Node Using the `add-agent.sh` Script, run the following commands:

```
sudo su spheron
```
```
cd
```
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment/main/scripts/add-agent.sh
```

- Use Vim or Nano to edit the `add-agent.sh` script. Update the master node IP and add child node IPs:

```sh
vim add-agent.sh
```
Edit the following lines:

```sh
SPHERON_NODE1_IP=[134.195.196.81] # your master node

# all you child nodes
nodes=(
    ["spheron-node2"]="134.195.196.213" ## add nodes like this in the list and change the node name if you want
)
```
- Run the Script on the Master Node

```sh
sudo chmod +x add-agent.sh
./add-agent.sh
```



## Adding a GPU Node

To add a GPU node to your Spheron cluster, follow these steps:

### Preparing a Node for Installation

#### 1. Prepare a node for the installation using Ansible from the [earlier step](/providers/setup-ansible).
#### 2. Clone the Provider Deployment Repository

If you haven't already, clone the Spheron provider deployment repository: [spheronFdn/provider-deployment](https://github.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment)

```
git clone https://github.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment.git
```

Repo has the following file structure: 
![Provider Deployment Repo](/provider-deployment-repo.webp)

#### 3. Edit the Inventory File

Open `playbook/inventory.ini` and update it with your server details. Example:

<Callout type="info">
Ensure you set up the server IP, username, and SSH key correctly.
</Callout>

```
[testnet] 
server-name ansible_host=23.158.40.38 ansible_user=root ansible_ssh_private_key_file=~/.ssh/id_rsa
```
#### 4. Execute the Ansible Playbook

```
cd playbook
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbook.yml
```
- The server will restart after the execution. When prompted, say `No` to the request for the first node.

![Provider Deployment Repo](/cpu-node-1.webp)

- Follow the Prompt like this:

![Provider Deployment Repo](/cpu-node-2.webp)

It will isntall the GPU drivers and some scripts.

#### 5. SSH into the Master Node
SSH into the first node (master node) of the cluster and follow the steps:

- Add the Node Using the `add-agent.sh` Script, run the following commands:

```
sudo su spheron
```
```
cd
```
```
wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/spheronFdn/provider-deployment/main/scripts/add-agent.sh
```

- Use Vim or Nano editor to edit the `add-agent.sh` script. Update the master node IP and add child node IPs:

```sh
vim add-agent.sh
```
- Edit the following lines:

```sh
SPHERON_NODE1_IP=134.195.196.81 # your master node

# all you child nodes
nodes=(
    ["spheron-node2"]="134.195.196.213" ## add nodes like this in the list and change the node name if you want
)
```
- Run the Script on the Master Node

```sh
sudo chmod +x add-agent.sh
./add-agent.sh
```

### Install the Nvidia Driver (First GPU Node Only)

<Callout type="warning">
  **NOTE: Only Execute the next 2 step in this section if this is the first GPU Node in your cluster.**
</Callout>

1. If this is the first GPU node, run these commands:

```
sudo su spheron
```
```
cd
```
```
helm repo add nvidia https://helm.ngc.nvidia.com/nvidia
helm repo add nvdp https://nvidia.github.io/k8s-device-plugin

helm repo update

kubectl apply -f /home/spheron/gpu-nvidia-runtime-class.yaml

helm upgrade -i nvdp nvdp/nvidia-device-plugin \
  --namespace nvidia-device-plugin \
  --create-namespace \
  --version 0.14.5 \
  --set runtimeClassName="nvidia"
```

2. Create the Nvidia RuntimeClass using the root user.
<Callout type="warning">
  **NOTE:** Only Execute if this is the first GPU node.
</Callout>

```
sudo su 
```
```
# Create NVIDIA RuntimeClass

kind: RuntimeClass
apiVersion: node.k8s.io/v1
metadata:
  name: nvidia
handler: nvidia
EOF
```
```
sudo su spheron
```

### Configure the New Node

<Callout type="warning">
  **NOTE:** Execute this on the new node which has the GPU in it by SSH into it.
</Callout>

1. SSH into the new node and check if the file `/etc/rancher/k3/config.yaml` exists:

```
cat /etc/rancher/k3/config.yaml
```
2. If the above command doesn't show any output, create the file using following command:

```
cat > /etc/rancher/k3/config.yaml <<'EOF'
containerd_additional_runtimes:
  - name: nvidia
    type: "io.containerd.runc.v2"
    engine: ""
    root: ""
    options:
      BinaryName: '/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime'
EOF
```

### Create a GPU Test Pod (First GPU Node Only)

<Callout type="warning">
  **NOTE:** 
  - Only Execute these next steps in this section if this is the first GPU Node in your cluster.
  - Please SSH back to the master node for the next steps.
</Callout>

SSH back to the master node and create a GPU test pod to check if the GPU is configured successfully with Kubernetes.

```
cat > gpu-test-pod.yaml << EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: nbody-gpu-benchmark
  namespace: default
spec:
  restartPolicy: OnFailure
  runtimeClassName: nvidia
  containers:
  - name: cuda-container
    image: nvcr.io/nvidia/k8s/cuda-sample:nbody
    args: ["nbody", "-gpu", "-benchmark"]
    resources:
      limits:
        nvidia.com/gpu: 1
    env:
    - name: NVIDIA_VISIBLE_DEVICES
      value: all
    - name: NVIDIA_DRIVER_CAPABILITIES
      value: all
EOF
```
```
kubectl apply -f gpu-test-pod.yaml
echo "Waiting 60 seconds for the test pod to start..."
sleep 60
kubectl get pods -A -o wide
kubectl logs nbody-gpu-benchmark
kubectl delete pod nbody-gpu-benchmark
```

### Update Provider Capabilities
On the new GPU node, update the provider configuration to add your GPU / CPU hardware and units:

1. Open the configuration file in a text editor:
```
vi /home/spheron/.spheron/provider-config.json
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** Refer to [Provider Configuration](/providers/setup-provider#create-provider-configuration) for checking the configuation structure and update it based on that.
</Callout>


2. Update the provider configuration into the `provider-config.json` file and save it.

3. Now update the config onchain by running the below commands:

```
sphnctl wallet use --name wallet --key-secret testPassword
```
```
sphnctl provider update --config /home/spheron/.spheron/provider-config.json
```

4. Then, you need to set provider GPU & CPU attributes for Spheron liveness points:

```
sphnctl provider set-attribute --config ~/.spheron/provider-config.json
```

<Callout type="info">
**Note:** If you get RPC error which running these command, you can retry it or reach out to team with the issue.
</Callout>

### Restart the Provider
Restart the provider on new GPU node to apply the new capabilities:

```
kubectl rollout restart statefulset/spheron-provider -n spheron-services
kubectl rollout restart deployment/operator-inventory -n spheron-services   
```

### Verify the node has GPU labels

<Callout type="info">
Note: To find the node name for this step, you need to execute the below step and take the first name in the list:
```
kubectl get nodes
```
</Callout>

```
kubectl describe node [Node Name] | grep -A10 Labels
```

## Adding Nodes with Private IP

### Prerequisites

1. The **Master node should have a public IP** and be accessible to the user.
2. The Master node must be able to **SSH into the private nodes**.

### Adding a Node

Since Both the Master and Child nodes are connected via a private network, we will utilize that for this setup.

#### Step 1: Install GPU Drivers (If the node has a GPU)
If the private node has a GPU, follow these steps to install the necessary drivers:

1. SSH into the private node:
   ```bash
   ssh <User>@<PrivateNodeIP>
   ```

2. Install the GPU drivers:
   ```bash
   sudo bash
   distribution=$(. /etc/os-release;echo $ID$VERSION_ID)
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | apt-key add -
   curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/$distribution/libnvidia-container.list | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/libnvidia-container.list
   apt-get -o Acquire::ForceIPv4=true update
   apt install ubuntu-drivers-common
   apt-get install -y nvidia-cuda-toolkit nvidia-container-toolkit nvidia-container-runtime 
   ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
   ```

3. Configure NVIDIA runtime for containerd:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p /etc/rancher/k3/
   cat > /etc/rancher/k3/config.yaml <<'EOF'
   containerd_additional_runtimes:
     - name: nvidia
       type: "io.containerd.runc.v2"
       engine: ""
       root: ""
       options:
         BinaryName: '/usr/bin/nvidia-container-runtime'
   EOF
   ```

4. Reboot the instance:
   ```bash
   sudo reboot
   ```

#### Step 2: Install `k3sup` on the Master Node

1. SSH into the Master node.

2. Download and Install `k3sup`:

   - Download the `k3sup` binary:
     ```bash
     curl -sLS https://get.k3sup.dev | sh
     ```

   - Move the binary to `/usr/local/bin`:
     ```bash
     sudo install k3sup /usr/local/bin/
     ```

   - Verify the installation:
     ```bash
     k3sup version
     ```

#### Step 3: Add the Child Node to the Cluster

1. Switch to a User with Access to the Private Node:

   If the user `ubuntu` can SSH into the private node (`ssh ubuntu@private-ip`), switch to that user on the Master node:
   ```bash
   sudo su ubuntu
   ```

2. Join the Child Node to the Cluster:

   Use the `k3sup join` command to add the private node to the cluster:
   ```bash
   k3sup join --ip <ChildPrivateIP> --server-ip <MasterNodePrivateIP> --user <Ubuntu>
   ```

   If SSH access is set up correctly, the child node will be added to the cluster.

#### Step 4: Verify the Node is Added Successfully

1. Switch back to the `spheron` user:
   ```bash
   sudo su spheron
   ```

2. Run the following command to verify that the node has been successfully added:
   ```bash
   kubectl get nodes
   ```

Now your provider should have GPU or new CPU hardware working 🚀🚀🚀
